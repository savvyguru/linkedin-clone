I am excited to share with all of you that I have joined Grab as Senior Software Engineer !

I would like to thank Nidhi Banga for the support throughout the recruiting process ! 

Getting the new job wouldnâ€™t have been possible without the constant support and motivation provided by my wife, Bhagyashree Khedkar, who really had to suffer a lot through my long study sessions, family back in India and friends !!

I am looking forward to use all my past experience, learn from and work with intelligent grabbers to drive Southeast Asia forward !! #softwareengineer #newbeginning #grabber" displayPicture="../../static/myimage.jpeg"/>
